# Introduction of IOT4B

## Terminology
[Terminology](https://github.com/ever-iot/docs/blob/main/terminology.md)

## Why blockchain?
The use of blockchain technology ensures that all backend and user data is stored in an encrypted format within a public blockchain, providing unparalleled security and access control.

## Data and access safety
- Your data is encrypted using the same key as your wallet, ensuring a high level of security.
- You can access it at any time without intermediaries.
- No third party can alter, damage, or erase your data, nor can restrict your access to it.
- Unauthorized access is impossible, guaranteeing complete data safety.

## Stability and income for vendors
- Vendors no longer need to pay for backend support, servers, storage, or compliance.
- By implementing our solution, vendors can reduce costs and receive a share of subscription payments from users, facilitated by transparent smart contracts.

## Privacy policy, user data, and all about that
- No third party can track your activity without your knowledge and consent.
- No third party can leak any of your data.
- Hostile software cannot damage or compromise your data due to blockchain encryption, making unauthorized access as difficult as hacking the entire blockchain through brute force.

# Components
- Everscale: The core blockchain platform.
- Node: Gateways between IoT devices and Everscale.
- Device: Smart devices connected to the network.
- Device Group: group of devices for management.
- Vendor: Manufacturers of smart devices.

# How to use

## Node
In this guide, you will learn how to install your own node. The node serves as a gateway between IoT devices and Everscale, facilitating data aggregation, smart contract initialization, access control, and notification services.

## Device management
Install the mobile application to manage your devices easily.

## Device client for Entware / OpenWRT
About [Entware](https://github.com/Entware) and [OpenWRT](https://github.com/openwrt).
Learn how to download and run the IOT4B Device Client on your OpenWRT router.

# All about Device data stored in blockchain

## Device operations
- Provides methods for managing devices via smart contracts (e.g., firmware updates, reboots).

## Two-way synchronization
- Ensures real-time data synchronization between devices and the blockchain.

## Safety
- Data encryption and decentralized storage ensure both security and stability.

# Smart contracts

[Follow the link](https://github.com/ever-iot/docs/blob/main/Contracts.md#smart-contracts)

## Custom smart contracts
You can create your own smart contracts to enhance the functionality of existing devices or to integrate devices with one another and with third-party systems.

# Are you a vendor?

## Why customers need it
Our solution empowers customers to take full control of their data and devices, ensuring transparency and alleviating concerns about inappropriate data usage by vendors.

## Additional income for vendors
Implementing our solution not only reduces costs but also enables vendors to generate revenue from subscription payments through smart contracts.

## Legal issues

### How IOT4B protects your business from lawsuits
By transferring data control to users, vendors are no longer responsible for data management, which simplifies compliance with regulations such as GDPR.

## Project status
We are in the final stages of developing our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and are ready to collaborate with vendors.
