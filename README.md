# Introduction of IOT4B

## Why blockchain?
IOT4B is a decentralized blockchain-based solution designed for smart devices. Blockchain technology ensures that all backend and user data is stored encrypted in a public blockchain, providing unparalleled security and access control.

## Data and access safety
- Your data is encrypted with the same key as your wallet.
- You can access it without any intermediates at any time.
- No third party can change, damage, or erase your data, nor restrict your access to it.
- No unauthorized access is possible, ensuring complete data safety.

## Stability and income for vendors
- Vendors no longer need to pay for backend support, servers, storage, and compliance.
- Implementing our solution reduces costs and enables vendors to receive a share of subscription payments from users, facilitated by transparent smart contracts.

## Privacy policy, user data, and all about that
- No third party can track your activity without your knowledge and permission.
- No third party can leak any of your data.
- Hostile software cannot damage or affect your data due to blockchain encryption, making unauthorized access as difficult as hacking the entire blockchain with brute force.
