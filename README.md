# Introduction of IOT4B

## Terminology
[Terminology](https://github.com/ever-iot/docs/blob/main/terminology.md)

## Why blockchain?
IOT4B is a decentralized blockchain-based solution designed for smart devices. Blockchain technology ensures that all backend and user data is stored encrypted in a public blockchain, providing unparalleled security and access control.

## Data and access safety
- Your data is encrypted with the same key as your wallet.
- You can access it without any intermediates at any time.
- No third party can change, damage, or erase your data, nor restrict your access to it.
- No unauthorized access is possible, ensuring complete data safety.

## Stability and income for vendors
- Vendors no longer need to pay for backend support, servers, storage, and compliance.
- Implementing our solution reduces costs and enables vendors to receive a share of subscription payments from users, facilitated by transparent smart contracts.

## Privacy policy, user data, and all about that
- No third party can track your activity without your knowledge and permission.
- No third party can leak any of your data.
- Hostile software cannot damage or affect your data due to blockchain encryption, making unauthorized access as difficult as hacking the entire blockchain with brute force.

# Components
- Everscale: The core blockchain platform.
- Node: Gateways between IoT devices and Everscale.
- Device: Smart devices connected to the network.
- Device Group: group of devices for management.
- Vendor: Manufacturers of smart devices.

# How to use

## Node
Here you can read how to install your own node. The node acts as a gateway between IoT devices and Everscale, providing data aggregation, smart contract initialization, access control, and notification services.

## Device management
Install the app to manage your devices easily.

## Device client for Entware / OpenWRT
About [Entware](https://github.com/Entware) and [OpenWRT](https://github.com/openwrt).
Learn how to download and run the IOT4B Device Client on your OpenWRT router.

# All about Device data stored in blockchain

## Device operations
- Provides methods for managing devices via smart contracts (e.g., firmware updates, reboots).

## Two-way synchronization
- Ensures real-time data synchronization between devices and the blockchain.

## Safety
- Data encryption and decentralized storage guarantee security and stability.

# Smart contracts

[Follow the link](https://github.com/ever-iot/docs/blob/main/Contracts.md#smart-contracts)

## Custom smart contracts
You can create your own smart contracts to extend current device functions or integrate devices with each other and third-party systems.

# Are you a vendor?

## Why customers need it
Our solution allows customers to take full control of their data and devices, providing transparency and eliminating concerns about inappropriate data use by vendors.

## Additional income for vendors
Implementing our solution not only reduces costs but also allows vendors to earn from subscription payments through smart contracts.

## Legal issues

### How IOT4B protects your business from lawsuits
By transferring data control to the users, vendors are no longer responsible for data management, simplifying compliance with regulations like GDPR.

## Project status
Current project status: final stage of MVP.
We are ready to cooperate with vendors.
