### Intro 
Vendors face various challenges with the exponential growth of digital information and services worldwide. Starting from government restrictions and laws, and finishing with hackers' activity.

### Pros
We offer a solution that addresses these challenges. 
This is how you benefit as a vendor:
- you no longer store your customersâ€™ data, so data protection rules are eased on you vastly
- your costs for hardware infrastructure and software development are reduced as you no longer need to run it at your end 
- you can even start earning rewards for each device using the solution, instead of spending on supporting its activity
- if you are a small or medium-sized producer of devices, you can get analytics tools allowing you to collect and use more market-related data, that was available to you before and adjust your sales strategy based on it.
- you can improve device functionality using cloud-based logic
- cross-devices integrations become easy and more efficient
